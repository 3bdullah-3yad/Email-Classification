# Emails-Classification

The data of this project contains 5572 emails and I built a model with Naive Bayes Algorithm to train it on Emails Classification (Ham or Spam).
 
Eventually, I reached Accuracy 98.85%, precision_score 97.2% and recall 94.054%.

This project is very simple for beginners.

I might evolve the code of this project to include data visualization.
