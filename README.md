# SMS-Classification

The data of this project contains 5572 SMSs and I built a model with Naive Bayes Algorithm to train it on SMSs Classification (Ham or Spam).
 
Eventually, I reached (=={Accuracy 98.994%}==) and (=={precision, recall and f1score 96.21%}==).

This project is very simple for beginners.
